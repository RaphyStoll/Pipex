# Pipex

## Summary

This project involves implementing a UNIX mechanism for handling pipes in the C programming
language. It is a programming exercise that helps understand and manipulate pipes, processes, and
file redirections in UNIX.

## Preface

This project is a detailed exploration of a UNIX mechanism through programming.

## Common Rules

- The project must be written in C.
- The code must follow the specified coding norm.
- Functions should not terminate unexpectedly.
- All allocated memory must be properly freed.
- A Makefile must be provided to compile the project.

## Mandatory Part

The `pipex` program should be executed with the following arguments:

```bash
./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2
```

- `file1` and `file2` are file names.
- `cmd1` and `cmd2` are shell commands with their parameters.

The program should behave like the following shell command:

```bash
< file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2
```

### Examples

1. `./pipex infile "ls -l" "wc -l" outfile`

   - Equivalent to: `< infile ls -l | wc -l > outfile`

2. `./pipex infile "grep ab" "wc -w" outfile`
   - Equivalent to: `< infile grep ab | wc -w > outfile`

## Bonus Part

Bonus features will include handling multiple pipes and `here_doc`. These features will be added
later.

## Submission and Peer Evaluation

Work must be submitted to the assigned Git repository. Only work present in the repository will be
evaluated.

## Compilation

To compile the project, use the following command:

```sh
make
```

## Execution

To run the program, use the following command:

```
./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2
```

Replace file1, cmd1, cmd2, and file2 with the appropriate values.
